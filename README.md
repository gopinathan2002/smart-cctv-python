The objective of this project is to design a hybrid intelligent CCTV surveillance system. That is,the system consists of  a PC-based system. I propose an Opensource package system that performs some of image processing tasks and sends the processed data to a PC.I have created a PC-based intelligent surveillance system that tracks persons and recognizes two-person interactions using a grayscale monochrome side-view image sequence captured by a single static camera. Based on my previous PC-based research, I explored a division of tasks between an  machine and a PC, simulated the  machine on Python, and designed an actual machine using a PC. This AI machine performs within three frame-cycle periods with a small code.
